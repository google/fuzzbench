# The order of execution is as follows:
# 1. Pull base-image, base-builder, base-runner.
# 2. After pulling base-image completes: Build base-image.
# 3. After pulling base-builder and building base-image completes: Build base-builder.
# 3. After pulling base-runner and building base-image completes: Build base-runner.
# This is optimized to take advantage of concurrency and caching as much as
# possible. When nothing changes, this does build takes two minutes to complete
# instead of ten.'
# See https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/speeding-up-builds for a discussion
# on using caching.
