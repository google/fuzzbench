# Running an experiment

This page explains how to run an experiment. It requires using Google Cloud.
Because most "users" of FuzzBench will be using it as a service and not running
it themselves, we consider this an advanced topic.

- TOC
{:toc}

Experiments are started by the `run_experiment.py` script. This will create a
dispatcher instance on Google Compute Engine which:
1. Builds desired fuzzer-benchmark combinations.
1. Starts instances to run fuzzing trials with the fuzzer-benchmark
   builds and stops them when they are done.
1. Measures the coverage from these trials.
1. Generates reports based on these measurements.

This page will walkthrough on how to use `run_experiment.py`.

# run_experiment.py

This page assumes a certain level of knowledge about Google Cloud and FuzzBench.
If you haven't already, please check out the guide on setting up a Google Cloud
Project to run FuzzBench.

## Experiment configuration file

You need to create an experiment configuration yaml file.
This will contain the configuration parameters for experiments that do not
change very often.
Below is an example configuration file with explanations of each required
parameter.

```yaml
# The number of trials of a fuzzer-benchmark pair to do.
trials: 5

# The amount of time in seconds that each trial is run for.
max_total_time: 86400

# The name of your Google Cloud project.
cloud_project: fuzzbench

# The Google Compute Engine zone to run the experiment in.
cloud_compute_zone: us-central1-a

# The Google Cloud Storage bucket that will store most of the experiment data.
cloud_experiment_bucket: gs://fuzzbench-data

# The bucket where HTML reports and summary data will be stored.
cloud_web_bucket: gs://fuzzbench-reports

# The connection to use to connect to the Google Cloud SQL instance.
cloud_sql_instance_connection_name: "fuzzbench:us-central1:postgres-experiment-db=tcp:5432"
```
## Setting the database password

Find the password for the PostgreSQL instance you are using in your
experiment config.
Set it using the environment variable `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` like so:

```bash
export POSTGRESS_PASSWORD="my-super-secret-password"
```

## Benchmarks
Pick the benchmarks you want to use from the `benchmarks/` directory.
For example: `freetype2-2017` and `bloaty_fuzz_target`.

## Fuzzers
Pick the fuzzers you want to use from the `fuzzers/` directory.
For example: `libfuzzer` and `afl`.

## Executing run_experiment.py
Now that everything is ready, execute `run_experiment.py`:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python3 experiment/run_experiment.py \
--experiment-config experiment-config.yaml \
--benchmarks freetype2-2017 bloaty_fuzz_target \
--experiment-name experiment-name \
--fuzzers afl libfuzzer
```

# Advanced usage

## Fuzzer configuration files

Many fuzzers have knobs that affect performance. To make it easier to tweak
these knobs in experiments `run_experiment.py` supports fuzzer configuration
files.
To use a "configured" fuzzer in an experiment, pass the configuration file to
`run_experiment.py` using the `--fuzzer-configs` argument. Below is an example
configuration file with an explanation of how it can configure a fuzzer.

```yaml
# The name of the fuzzer in fuzzers/ we want to run.
fuzzer: libfuzzer

# The name that we want to use for this configuration (e.g. results for this
# configuration show up in reports under the name "libfuzzer_value_profile")
variant_name: libfuzzer_value_profile

# Environment variables that are set before running the fuzzer's fuzzer.py
# script. Note that these have no meaning to fuzzbench, it's up to fuzzer.py
# to do something with them. See fuzzers/libfuzzer/fuzzer.py
# (https://github.com/google/fuzzing/blob/master/fuzzers/libfuzzer/fuzzer.py)
# for how ADDITIONAL_ARGS is used.
env:
  ADDITIONAL_ARGS: -use_value_profile=1

```

Currently values in `env` are only set before running the fuzzer, not before
building the benchmarks or the fuzzer itself.
