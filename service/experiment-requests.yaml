# Experiment requests have the following format:
#
# - experiment: 2020-06-08  # The name of the experiment
#   fuzzers:  # The fuzzers to run in the experiment.
#     - aflplusplus
#     - libfuzzer
#
# The name of the experiment must begin with a date using this format:
# YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day). It's not important what timezone is used in
# deciding the date or if this is a day or two off. The most important thing is
# that is unique.
# If there already is an experiment for a particular date in this file, you can
# either: add a suffix (e.g. "-aflplusplus" or "-2") to the experiment name, or
# use the next date.
#
# You can run "make presubmit" to do basic validation on this file.
# Please add new experiment requests towards the top of this file.
# NOTE: Users of the FuzzBench service should not be editing this file yet, we
# are still testing this feature. You should request an experiment by contacting
# us as you normally do.
