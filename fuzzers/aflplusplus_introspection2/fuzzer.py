"""Integration code for AFLplusplus fuzzer."""

# This optimized afl++ variant should always be run together with
# "aflplusplus" to show the difference - a default configured afl++ vs.
# a hand-crafted optimized one. afl++ is configured not to enable the good
# stuff by default to be as close to vanilla afl as possible.
# But this means that the good stuff is hidden away in this benchmark
# otherwise.
