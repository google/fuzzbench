"""Integration code for two AFL instances. This one is useful
   since some hybrid fuzzers rely on multiple processes, e.g.
   one for AFL and one for concolic execution, and thus potentially
   claim more total CPU power than a single AFL process. Examples
   of this include SymCC and Eclipser.
   This integration is to have a fairer comparison between such
   integrations."""
